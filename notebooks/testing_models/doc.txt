For Creating Java Test Set:
* Creating both Few Shot and Zero Shot prompts
* Using triangle area (index 45) as few shot for all
    * For traingle area (index 45) the add method (index 53) is used
* Using full definitions up until the unit tests are created
    * Full class and function definitions provided, but that's it
* Examples with other starts to test methods:
    * [38, 50]: Create char array of lowercase alphabet and Random for random_string method
        * random_string is fully defined, and then the main (test) method is initialized
    * [162]: Just includes NoSuchAlgorithmException declaration after main method declaration and before closing bracket
